# Escape The Cave
## Minimum Project Requirements
**This final project will consist of developing a 2D Top down game:**
- You are controlling a character going through a world of your choice.  
- Your player will go through levels, each consisting of several types of blocks, enemies, moving enemies, collectibles (coins and other), doors, power ups, etc...  

**Game Design:**  
- You required to work on a Game Design Document, dissecting your game elements, controls, levels, enemies, game mechanics and gameplay elements.  
- The Game Design Document should be concise and well organized. 
- The document can be just a few pages long since the project is not big. 

**Make sure you include the following:**
- All levels should be built using arrays, any project lacking array based levels will be considered incomplete. 
- Game should include Sound Effects. 
- You Hero can have either a health bar or hearts, or simply die from 1 hit. 
- He will respawn at the initial position that he started the level at. 
- Your Hero will have a weapon of choice, shooting at the enemies. 
- Each enemy can require a certain number of shots to die, increasing the variety of the enemies and of the gameplay overall. 
- Make sure that each level has one game mechanic, for instance, the door opens only if you collect all coins in the level, where some of those coins are hidden, or guarded by a timer door for example. 
- Each mechanics that you introduce should be presented to the player incrementally, have at least 3 levels for each design idea;  
For instance timed doors: 
  - Level 1 : Introduce the timed doors. 
  - Level 2 : Test the player using the timed doors. 
  - Level 3 : Challenge the player with an even harder puzzle using the timed doors concept. 
  - Apply this to all elements you add to the game. 
- You can introduce more than 1 element per level and have a variety of mechanics in 4 or 5 levels. 
- Game design is key in this project, adding creative level design elements, and challenging the player to solve puzzles or beating the clock after collecting a key in order to get in that special areas. 
- Enemies can be stationary or moving, you can introduce spikes, rolling blocks, fire pits or traps. 
- Heavily rely on timers for most elements in your game, control doors, powerups, main game timers and other. 
- Your game should feature at least 4~5 levels, enough to introduce at least 2 game mechanics. 
- Introduce several powerups (time freeze, shield, weapons, etc..). 
- Make sure to work on a specific theme and add sound effects to your game.
